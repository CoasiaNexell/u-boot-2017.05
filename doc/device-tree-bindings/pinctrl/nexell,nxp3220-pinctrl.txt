Nexell nxp3320 pin mux/config controller
========================================

Nexell's nxp3220 SoC provides pin mux/config hardware controller.
It controls the input/output settings on the available pads/pins and also
provides ability to multiplex and configure the output of various on-chip
controllers onto these pads.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
phrase "pin configuration node".

Required properties:
  - compatible: may be "nexell,nxp3220-pinctrl"
  - reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. It contains
  the information of registers in the same order as described by reg-names
  - reg-names: Should contain the reg names

Example:
	pinctrl@20180000 {
		compatible = "nexell,nxp3220-pinctrl";
		reg = <0x20180000 0x1000>,
		      <0x20190000 0x1000>,
		      <0x201a0000 0x1000>,
		      <0x201b0000 0x1000>,
		      <0x201c0000 0x1000>,
		      <0x2008d000 0x1000>;
		reg-names = "gpioa", "gpiob", "gpioc", "gpiod", "gpioe",
		            "alive";
		u-boot,dm-pre-reloc;
	};

  Child nodes must be set at least one of the following settings:
  - nexell,pins = Select pins for using this function.
  - nexell,pin-function = Select the function for use in a selected pin.
  - nexell,pin-pull = Pull up/down configuration.
  - nexell,pin-strength = Drive strength configuration.

  Valid values for nexell,pins are:
     "gpioX-N"		: X in {A,B,C,D,E}, N in {0-31}
  Valid values for nexell,pin-function are:
     "NX_PIN_FUNC0", "NX_PIN_FUNC1", "NX_PIN_FUNC2", "NX_PIN_FUNC3"
                 This setting means that the value is different for each pin.
                 Please refer to datasheet.
  Valid values for nexell,pin-pull are:
     "NX_PIN_PULL_DOWN", "NX_PIN_PULL_UP", "NX_PIN_PULL_NONE"
  Valid values for nexell,pin-strength are:
     "NX_PIN_STR0", "NX_PIN_STR1", "NX_PIN_STR2", "NX_PIN_STR3"


Example:
  - pin settings
	nand_pin:nandpin {
		nexell,pins = "gpiob-9", "gpiob-10", "gpiob-11", "gpiob-12",
			      "gpiob-13", "gpiob-14", "gpiob-15", "gpiob-16",
			      "gpiob-17", "gpiob-18", "gpiob-19", "gpiob-20",
			      "gpiob-21", "gpiob-22", "gpiob-23", "gpiob-24";
		nexell,pin-function = <NX_PIN_FUNC1>;
		nexell,pin-pull = <NX_PIN_PULL_NONE>;
		nexell,pin-strength = <0>;
	};


  - used by client devices
	nand:nand-controller@... {
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&nand_pin>;
		...
	};
