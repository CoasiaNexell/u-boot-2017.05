Silicon Mitus, SM5011 pmic

This device uses two drivers:
- drivers/power/pmic/sm5011.c (for parent device)
- drivers/power/regulator/sm5011.c (for child regulators)

This file describes the binding info for the PMIC driver.

To bind the regulators, please read the additional binding info:
- doc/device-tree-bindings/regulator/sm5011.txt

Required properties:
- compatible: "sm,sm5011"
- reg = 0x47

With those two properties, the pmic device can be used for read/write only.
To bind each regulator, the optional regulators subnode should exists.

Optional subnode:
- voltage-regulators: subnode list of each device's regulator
  (see sm5011.txt - regulator binding info)

Example:

sm5011: sm5011@47 {
	compatible = "sm,sm5011";
	reg = <0x47>;
};
